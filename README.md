# Pydew Valley
A Stardew Valley spinoff game created with Python using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9apl6B_ZgI).

## Purpose
I completed this project in my free time to learn Python and Pygame! The tutorial was very comprehensible and I feel that I can continue on to add my own features.

## Plans for Future Implementation
* [ ] Add a start menu
* [ ] Add a pause menu
* [ ] Add an options menu
* [ ] Add a way to save/load the game
* [ ] Add better music, change it with time of day and/or weather
* [ ] Add new types of crops
* [ ] Add seasons
* [ ] Improve UI and transitions
